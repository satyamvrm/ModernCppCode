                - Return a callable as a value
                - save function as "values" in container/variables
        - Referance Wrapper
            - it is an object that internally stores referance to "something"
            - it uses pointer to referacne conversation internally
            - it can be replacement for raw reference everywhere in the code
            - rvalue cannot be converted into referances
        - Bind
            - use to create a partial function
                - a function some parameters are already fixed
