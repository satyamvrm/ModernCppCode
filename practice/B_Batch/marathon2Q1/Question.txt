Implement a C++ program that performs the following tasks:

It prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns for a 2D array.
It then asks the user to fill in the data for each cell of the array.

After filling in the data, it calculates and displays the sum of each row of the array. -> SumOfEachRow()

It also determines and prints the maximum element in each column of the array. -> MaxOfEachColumn()

Finally, it calculates and shows the square of the last element of the array. -> SquareOfLastElement()

Ensure that your program is modular and utilizes function pointers in C++ to execute different operations on the array.
Your program should adhere to the following specifications:
Define functions to perform each of the tasks mentioned above: fillData, sumRow, maxRow, and lastSquare.
Use a function called Adaptor that accepts a function pointer and executes the corresponding function with the given parameters.
Use dynamic memory allocation to create a 2D array based on the user-provided dimensions.
Properly deallocate the memory after the tasks are completed.
Write the C++ program fulfilling the above requirements.
