// Linea search
operation : Access item and compare!
N : size of elements to be checked

Time complexcity : O(N)

Time complexcity is concerned about "How many operations" per input elements.

step 1 : Always find relation between N (number of input items) and operation where "operation" is context specific
    e.g. : 
        In Liner search, operation is access element and compare.
        In Binary search, check middle, if found, okay else divide.

        return a boolean to indicate wheather at least one car has price over 7 lacs

~    N + N-1 + N-2 + N-3 + ... + 1    =  ----------  =  -----------
