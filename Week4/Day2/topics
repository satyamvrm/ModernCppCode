Algorithm covered

1. std::count_if:
    count instances of matching condition

2. std::find_if:
    find the position of first instance that staisfy the condiotion

3. std::all_of:
    return true if all satisy the condtition.

4. std::any_of:
    return true if any instance satisfy the condtion

5. std::none_of:
    return true only when NONE of the instances match condition, false otherwise

6. std::copy:
    copy all elements from source to destination

7. std::copy_if:
    copy element that satisfy condion from source to destination
    Note : remember to set size, copy_if and then resize using distance

8. std::accumalate:
    aggregate multiple elements into 1 by performing a progressive, binary operation of your choice

9. std::max_element:
    find the position of the first max element[based on comparator]

10. std::min_element:  
    find the position of the first minimum element
