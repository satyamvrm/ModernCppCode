/* 
    Producer Consumer Problem
    2 workers in your program
        1 may produce "something"
        the other will "consume it" (process the produced item)
*/
/*  
    2 threads (2 workers)
        - main thread (producer) : take input and "make value avaliable" 
        - operation(t1)[consumer] : Once a signal is recived from main to indicate "input received", calculate the square
            a. progamer caluculate how many workers are requested and triggered them at a time [thread pooling]
            b. t1 may want to do someother work even before data input is recived
